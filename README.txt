This is my microservice learning journey!

I am thought by Java Brains youtube videos about microservices!
The videos are detailed, easy to follow and explained for a way that a beginner would understand. His videos are divided into level of complexity and knowledge.

Links to the videos:

PS: I would be adding the level video links when I have complete the given level.
